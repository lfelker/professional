      <p>
        I am broadly interested in maps, data visualization, software development, accessibility, and ecology. I recently received my Bachelor's from the University of Washington Computer Science program. My experience during that time includes studying the ecological impacts of climate change as a field crew leader and researcher in the <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/jhrl/Index.html"  target="_blank">HRL Lab</a> and working as a software developer for <a href="https://www.accessmapseattle.com/"  target="_blank">Access Map</a> where I developed an interactive map for Android devices to help people with limited mobility navigate Seattle.
      </p>
      <p>
        After graduating I traveled for a year, bicycling throughout Southeast Asia and thru-hiking the entire Appalachian Trail, and have recently settled back in Seattle, WA to pursue a career in software development and map making. I am currently employed as a Geospatial Software Engineer for Access Map where I am working to expand the data visualization and routing capabilities of the web and mobile apps to encompass all of King County.

         Bike Nashville is an ongoing project that aims to simplify the experience of choosing a safe and effective bike route in Nashville, TN. The map currently distributed by the city of Nashville is out of date, has incomplete routes, is visually hard to understand, and is primarily designed for tourists. Additionally, routing applications, like google maps, often give routes that prioritize speed over safety. With Bike Nashville you can visualize bike infrastructure along a recommended route and visualize potential alternative paths that might be more safe or scenic.

        <p>
         This project involved compiling data - from Open Street Map, Nashville's Planning Department, and locals' knowlege of good routes - to build shapefiles in QGIS that are comprehensive and up to date. I initially designed the graphics of the map in QGIS and later translated them to MapBox. You can see the current interactive beta version by clicking on the map <a href="https://lfelker.github.io/bike_nashville/" target="_blank">here</a>.
